Automatic Headlight Dimmer!
Welcome to the Automatic Headlight Dimmer project! This initiative aims to enhance nighttime driving safety by developing an intelligent system that automatically adjusts the brightness of vehicle headlights based on the surrounding conditions. This project can contribute to preventing accidents and improving overall road safety during nighttime travel.

Features
Adaptive Brightness Control: Automatically adjusts the intensity of vehicle headlights in response to oncoming traffic and ambient light conditions.

Machine Vision Integration: Utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect the presence of other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles, optimizing headlight brightness accordingly.

Weather Sensing: Factors in weather conditions such as rain, fog, or snow to ensure optimal visibility without causing glare or discomfort to other road users.

Customizable Settings: Allows users to customize sensitivity levels, response times, and other parameters to suit individual preferences and driving conditions.

Real-time Monitoring: Constantly monitors the environment and makes instant adjustments to ensure optimal visibility and safety.
